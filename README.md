# Permanent Sacrifical Twig
Permanent effect of Sacrificial Twig; it also works as a counter to the rune loss from Death Blight (the effect spawns the lost runes on the ground and you can immediately retrieve them upon respawning).
- If you have the Erd Tools mod with "pickup_lost_runes" set to 1, the retrieval is automatic.
